# python-image-color-spaces-cv2-OpenCV
In order to learn and practice theory of color spaces in python, this repository reads an image, prints height and width properties, and shows the image using OpenCV. It also uses cv2 library to convert image to gray scale and takes this image to colorize it red, blue or green depending on the user's desicion. Finally, it highlights hue tones.
